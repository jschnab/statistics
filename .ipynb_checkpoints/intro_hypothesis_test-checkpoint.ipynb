    "# Introduction to hypothesis testing\n",
    "Remember that :\n",
    "* the distribution of sample means $\\bar{x}$ based on samples of size $n$ follows a $t$-distribution with a mean $\\mu$, a standard deviation $\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$ and $n - 1$ degrees of freedom.\n",
    "* $t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}}$ is from a $t$-distribution with a mean of 0, variance of 1 and $n - 1$ degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The single-sample t-test\n",
    "This is used to test whether the mean $\\mu$ of a normally distributed population is at a specific value $\\mu_0$. The null hypothesis is that the population mean is $\\mu_0$ : $H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$. The alternative hypothesis is that $\\mu$ is not equal to $\\mu_0$ : $H_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the null hypothesis, a random sample is taken from the population and the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ and the sample standard deviation $s$ are calculated. The value of $t$ is calculated with the above formula. There is a 95 % chance that $t$ lies between values calculated with the percent point function : $PPF(0.025)$ and $PPF(0.975)$ with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. For a sample of size 10, $PPF(0.025)=-2.262$ and $PPF(0.975)=2.262$ so we reject the null hypothesis if $t < -2.262$ or if $t > 2.262$. This is an example of a **two-tailed test** because before collecting the data we do not know if $\\bar{x}$ will be greater or less than $\\mu_0$. To carry out a **one-tailed test** $t$ would be compared to $PPF(0.05)$ or $PPF(0.95)$. One could also directly calculate $PPF(t)$ and this would give the probability of observing a larger $t$-value than the one obtained if the null hypothesis is true. This probability is called the **p-value**.\n",

    "The following shows an example of a two-tailed single-sample $t$-test. The mean yield of the reference oat variety is 2.0 t/ha. A new variety is tested and yields obtained from a sample of 6 plots are calculated."
